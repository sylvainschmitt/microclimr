#' HOBO micrloclimatic data from the Mormal forest
#'
#' Air temperature at 1-m above the ground at every hour for the sensor
#' "59-32-a" in 2023 within plot "59-32" from the Mormal forest. Data are from
#' the ANR IMPRINT Project (2019-2023): temperature time series of each plot for
#' the three studied forests (Mormal, Blois and Aigoual). Two HOBO sensors were
#' placed at the center of each of 60 plots, to measure air temperature (1 m
#' above the ground; every hour), and soil temperature (8 cm below the ground;
#' every two hours). This dataset is a compilation of all soil and air
#' temperatures measured by HOBO sensors in each plot: (1) Mormal forest: the
#' time series ranges from 2020-08-03 to 2023-10-23; (2) Blois forest: the time
#' series ranges from 2020-07-11 to 2023-08-28; (3) Aigoual forest: the time
#' series ranges from 2020-07-31 to 2023-09-17. Note that some plots may have
#' holes (missing data) in the time series.
